      <title>Contributing a Patch via GitHub</title>

      <description>Several people mentioned in our MUC that they have problems contributing code to the Profanity repo on GitHub because &amp;ldquo;forking all the time is cumbersome&amp;rdquo;.
Let me show you an example workflow. Since I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s cumbersome at all. I assume you have an account on GitHub and are logged in. First thing we do is fork the repo. So go to https://github.com/profanity-im/profanity and click on &amp;ldquo;Fork&amp;rdquo;. Now you should be at your fork, in my case this is: https://github.</description>

      <title>XML console in Profanity</title>

      <description>Profanity is an XMPP client that allows you to chat with friends. But one feature makes it more than just a client. The name is XML console.
It has been implemented for a long time now, but hasn&amp;rsquo;t found wide spread within Profanity community. I still believe that the XML console is unpopular because users haven&amp;rsquo;t chance to find it and to try it out. And Profanity community has a number of experts who use XMPP in their projects.</description>

      <title>How to run profanity instances within tmux</title>

      <description>If you have more than one XMPP account, you may run one profanity process per account. For example profanity -a AccountName.
It&amp;rsquo;s possible to start a tmux session with one window for each profanity instance.
Create a tmux configuration file, e.g. in ~/.config/tmux.
mkdir ~/.config/tmux touch ~/.config/tmux/profanity.conf  Within the configuration file, you create a tmux session named Profanity. Followed by one window per XMPP Account. Each window will run a profanity followed by -a accountname.</description>

      <title>Last Message Correction</title>

      <description>From 10th to 14th February 2020 we had Hackweek 19 at SUSE. Part of that time I used to finally implement the long (since 2016!) sought after Last Message Correction feature, aka XEP-0308.
See my Hackweek project and the corresponding pull request.
Usage To enable incoming and outgoing corrections users need to enable it with /correction on, see /help correction for more details.
Now we write a message to a friend /msg Martin Hey therr!</description>

      <title>How to get a backtrace</title>
      <link>https://profanity-im.github.io/blog/post/how-to-get-a-backtrace/</link>

      <guid>https://profanity-im.github.io/blog/post/how-to-get-a-backtrace/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re running profanity master it may occur that profanity crashes
with SIGSEGV or SIGABRT when new features are added. If this happens it
is helpful to provide a backtrace for the developers to find and fix the
bug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will explain one possibility how to get a backtrace of profanity
(or any other TUI application)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
